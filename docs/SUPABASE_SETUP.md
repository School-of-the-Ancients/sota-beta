# Supabase Configuration

School of the Ancients now persists user data with Supabase so conversations, quests, and progress follow learners across devices. Follow these steps to provision and connect the backend.

## 1. Create a Supabase project
1. Visit [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project.
2. Choose a strong password for the database and wait for provisioning to finish.
3. In the project dashboard open **Project Settings â†’ API**. Copy the **Project URL** and **anon public key** &mdash; you will add these to `.env` shortly.

## 2. Define the `user_state` table
The frontend expects a single JSON record per user that captures conversations, quests, and progress. Create the table using the SQL editor in Supabase (or psql):

```sql
create table if not exists public.user_state (
  user_id uuid primary key references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
  state jsonb not null default '{}'::jsonb,
  updated_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

alter table public.user_state enable row level security;

create policy "Users manage their own state"
  on public.user_state
  for all
  using (auth.uid() = user_id)
  with check (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

> **Tip:** The table stores the entire serialized app state. Supabase handles JSONB efficiently, and schema migrations can reshape the payload over time.

## 3. Configure environment variables
Create (or update) your `.env` file in the repo root with the Gemini key plus Supabase credentials:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-public-anon-key
```

Restart `npm run dev` after editing `.env` so Vite picks up the new variables.

## 4. Test the connection
1. Run `npm run dev` and visit the app.
2. Click **Sign in** in the top-right corner. Create an account (Supabase email/password auth) or sign in with an existing user.
3. Open the network tab; you should see `user_state` upsert calls as you finish conversations, create quests, or take quizzes.

If the modal reports that Supabase is not configured, double-check the environment variables. Authentication will stay disabled until both values are present.

## 5. Deploying
When deploying, set the same environment variables on your hosting platform. The frontend uses Supabase's JavaScript client directly, so no additional proxy is required.

With Supabase wired up you can remove the old `localStorage` bootstrapping code and trust the backend to keep learner progress consistent across sessions.
