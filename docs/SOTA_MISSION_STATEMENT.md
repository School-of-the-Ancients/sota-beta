## ‚ö° The Problem

Students aren‚Äôt learning ‚Äî they‚Äôre shortcutting.  
ChatGPT gives instant answers, but not understanding.  

Most learners:
- Don‚Äôt know what questions to ask to actually learn.  
- Skip the reasoning and reflection that lead to mastery.  
- Lack motivation, feedback, and a structured learning journey.
